# BigQuery Performance Benchmark
This repository contains a proof-of-concept for benchmarking the performance of various insertion methods in Google BigQuery. It targets developers aiming to optimize bulk data ingestion processes and evaluate insertion techniques under different data loads and configurations.

## Description
This project evaluates three BigQuery insertion methods (insert_rows_json, insert_rows, and multi-line SQL INSERT statements) using Python. The script generates synthetic data of varying sizes (0.156 KB, 1 KB, and 10 KB per row) and measures the time taken to insert records. Results are saved in a CSV file for further analysis.

##Key Features
- Synthetic Data Generation: Dynamically generates rows of specified sizes using Python.
- Performance Metrics: Compares insertion times for various data sizes and record counts.
- CSV Collateral: Automatically exports results for visualization in tools like Excel.

## Techniques Used
This project incorporates several advanced techniques:

- Synthetic Data Generation:
	-Utilizes Python's uuid for unique IDs and string multiplication for scalable field sizes.
	- Demonstrates dynamic data generation for BigQuery schema alignment.

- BigQuery Client Usage:
	- Employs the google-cloud-bigquery library for interacting with BigQuery tables.
	- Illustrates inserting rows with JSON and direct row insertion using Python.

- Performance Timing:
	- Implements Python's time module for precise measurement of insertion durations.

- CSV File Output:
	- Uses the csv module to write benchmark results for easy graphing and further analysis.

## Areas of Interest

Professional developers may find the following techniques noteworthy:
1. Row Size Estimation:
	- Calculates row sizes dynamically by subtracting fixed field overhead from the target size.
	- Demonstrates efficient memory handling for large synthetic datasets.

2. Error Handling in BigQuery Insertions:
	- Captures and logs detailed errors during insertion operations.
	- Provides a template for debugging and error analysis in production systems.

3. Exporting Collateral for Analysis:
	- Simplifies the performance evaluation process by exporting metrics in CSV format.
	- Encourages using tools like Excel for visualizing trends and optimizing methods.
